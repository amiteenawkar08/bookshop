		  <p>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (commonly Alice in Wonderland) is an 1865 English children's novel by Lewis Carroll (a pseudonym of Charles Dodgson).[1] A young girl named Alice falls through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world of anthropomorphic creatures. It is seen as a prime example of the literary nonsense genre.[2][3] Its play with logic gives the story lasting popularity with adults as well as children.[2]

One of the best-known works of Victorian English fiction, its narrative, structure, characters and imagery have had huge influence on popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre.[3][4][5] The book has never been out of print and has been translated into at least 97 languages.[6] Its legacy covers adaptations for stage, screen, radio, art, ballet, theme parks, board games and video games.[7] Carroll published a sequel in 1871 entitled Through the Looking-Glass and a shortened version for young children, The Nursery "Alice", in 1890.
